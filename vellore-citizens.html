    <h1>Vellore Citizens Welfare Forum v. Union of India (1996)</h1>
    <p><strong>Citation:</strong> AIR 1996 SC 2715; (1996) 5 SCC 647[file:54]</p>
    <p><strong>Bench:</strong> Kuldip Singh, Faizan Uddin and K. Venkataswami, JJ.[file:54]</p>

    <h3>Background:</h3>
    <p>
      This public interest petition under Article 32 was filed by Vellore Citizens Welfare Forum highlighting severe environmental degradation caused by hundreds of tanneries and other industries in Tamil Nadu discharging untreated effluents into agricultural lands, open areas, and ultimately into the Palar river, the main source of drinking water for local residents.[file:54]
    </p>
    <p>
      Surveys and official reports showed extensive contamination of surface and groundwater, damage to nearly 35,000 hectares of agricultural land, and widespread shortage of potable water in dozens of villages, despite years of governmental directions to install effluent treatment plants.[file:54]
    </p>

    <h3>Issues:</h3>
    <p>
      Whether the Court could direct closure or regulation of polluting industries and impose liability for compensation and remediation, and how emerging principles of international environmental law—particularly the precautionary principle and the polluter pays principle—fit within Articles 21, 47, 48A and 51A(g) of the Constitution.[file:54]
    </p>

    <h3>Judgement:</h3>
    <p>
      The Supreme Court recognized the precautionary principle and polluter pays principle as essential features of Indian environmental law, holding that they are part of the law of the land under Article 21 and relevant directive principles and fundamental duties.[file:54]
    </p>
    <p>
      The Court ordered closure of non‑compliant tanneries, directed that no highly polluting industry be permitted within one kilometre of specified water sources, required the tanneries to pay compensation to affected persons and for restoration of the damaged environment, and mandated strict enforcement of pollution control standards.[file:54]
    </p>

    <h3>Key Takeaways:</h3>
    <ul style="margin-left:20px; font-size:1.1rem;">
      <li>
        The precautionary principle and polluter pays principle are part of Indian environmental jurisprudence and must guide State action and judicial review in pollution cases.[file:54]
      </li>
      <li>
        Polluters are liable not only to compensate affected individuals but also to bear the cost of restoring degraded ecology; environmental costs cannot be externalised onto the public.[file:54]
      </li>
      <li>
        Courts can order closure of industries, impose “pollution fines”, and enforce stringent location and discharge standards where persistent non‑compliance threatens the right to a healthy environment.[file:54]
      </li>
      <li>
        Environmental protection orders can draw strength from constitutional provisions including Article 21 (right to life), Article 48A (State’s duty to protect environment) and Article 51A(g) (citizen’s duty).[file:54]
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Significance:</h3>
    <p>
      The ruling is a milestone in Indian environmental law, firmly embedding international sustainable development principles into domestic constitutional practice and strengthening judicial tools to address industrial pollution.[file:54]
    </p>
    <p>
      It continues to be cited for the scope of PIL in environmental matters, the content of the right to a healthy environment, and the contours of liability and remediation for large‑scale ecological harm.[file:54]
