    <h1>Arnesh Kumar v. State of Bihar (2014)</h1>
    <p><strong>Citation:</strong> (2014) 8 SCC 273; AIR 2014 SC 2756[file:58]</p>
    <p><strong>Bench:</strong> Chandramauli Kr. Prasad and Pinaki Chandra Ghose, JJ.[file:58]</p>

    <h3>Background:</h3>
    <p>
      The appellant, husband of respondent Sweta Kiran, faced arrest under Section 498A IPC (cruelty) and Section 4 Dowry Prohibition Act based on allegations of dowry demands by in-laws (₹8 lakhs, car, AC, TV) and threats of second marriage.[file:58]
    </p>
    <p>
      Anticipatory bail was denied by Sessions Court and Patna High Court; the Supreme Court noted the routine arrests in 498A cases (1,97,762 arrests in 2012 per NCRB data), low conviction rate (15%), and frequent misuse against relatives including elderly women.[file:58]
    </p>

    <h3>Issues:</h3>
    <p>
      Whether mechanical arrests under Section 498A IPC (cognizable, non-bailable offences punishable up to 7 years) violate personal liberty under Article 21, and what safeguards exist under Sections 41, 41A CrPC to prevent routine arrests without necessity.[file:58]
    </p>

    <h3>Judgement:</h3>
    <p>
      The Supreme Court granted bail and issued mandatory nationwide guidelines prohibiting automatic arrests in 498A cases; police must satisfy Section 41 CrPC conditions (necessity to prevent further offence, tampering, etc.) and record reasons before arrest.[file:58]
    </p>
    <p>
      Magistrates must scrutinise police reports before authorising detention; Section 41A notice of appearance must be issued where arrest is not necessary; non-compliance invites departmental action and contempt proceedings.[file:58]
    </p>

    <h3>Key Takeaways:</h3>
    <ul style="margin-left:20px; font-size:1.1rem;">
      <li>
        Arrest is not automatic for cognizable offences; police must justify under Section 41(1)(b) CrPC why arrest is necessary (prevent further crime, proper investigation, evidence tampering, etc.) and record reasons in writing.[file:58]
      </li>
      <li>
        Magistrates must independently verify compliance with Section 41 before authorising detention under Section 167; mechanical detention orders are liable for departmental action.[file:58]
      </li>
      <li>
        Section 41A CrPC mandates notice of appearance where arrest is not required; accused complying cannot be arrested without recorded reasons.[file:58]
      </li>
      <li>
        Guidelines apply to all offences punishable up to 7 years; States must issue checklists and train police; copy of judgment circulated to Chief Secretaries/DGPs for compliance.[file:58]
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Significance:</h3>
    <p>
      Arnesh Kumar revolutionised arrest procedures for 498A and similar offences, curbing misuse as a harassment tool while protecting genuine victims; it enforces constitutional liberty safeguards against overzealous policing.[file:58]
    </p>
    <p>
      The judgment's mandatory directions have reduced frivolous arrests nationwide and established judicial oversight over police discretion, influencing CrPC interpretation across matrimonial and minor offence cases.[file:58]
