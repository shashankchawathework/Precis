    <h1>Selvi & Ors. v. State of Karnataka (2010)</h1>
    <p><strong>Citation:</strong> AIR 2010 SC 1974; (2010) 7 SCC 263; (2010) 3 SCC (Cri) 1[file:52]</p>
    <p><strong>Bench:</strong> K.G. Balakrishnan CJI, R.V. Raveendran and J.M. Panchal, JJ.[file:52]</p>

    <h3>Background:</h3>
    <p>
      Several criminal appeals raised common questions about the involuntary administration of scientific techniques—narcoanalysis, polygraph (lie-detector) examination, and Brain Electrical Activation Profile (BEAP) tests—on accused persons, suspects, and witnesses during investigation.[file:52]
    </p>
    <p>
      The techniques were defended as tools to strengthen investigation and curb third-degree methods, while challenges focused on violations of the right against self‑incrimination under Article 20(3) and personal liberty, privacy, and protection from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment under Article 21.[file:52]
    </p>

    <h3>Issues:</h3>
    <p>
      Whether involuntary administration of narcoanalysis, polygraph, and BEAP tests violates the protection against self‑incrimination in Article 20(3) and whether such compulsory testing is a permissible restriction on personal liberty under Article 21, including the rights to privacy, mental autonomy, and freedom from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.[file:52]
    </p>

    <h3>Judgement:</h3>
    <p>
      The Supreme Court held that the involuntary administration of narcoanalysis, polygraph examination, and BEAP tests violates Article 20(3) because the results amount to “testimonial compulsion” by extracting personal knowledge from the subject, and therefore cannot be used against that person in criminal proceedings.[file:52]
    </p>
    <p>
      The Court further held that such compulsory tests offend Article 21 as unreasonable intrusions into bodily and mental privacy and as degrading treatment; these techniques can be used only with the voluntary, informed consent of the subject, with safeguards, and even then results are not substantive evidence but at best can lead to further investigation.[file:52]
    </p>

    <h3>Key Takeaways:</h3>
    <ul style="margin-left:20px; font-size:1.1rem;">
      <li>
        Involuntary narcoanalysis, polygraph, and BEAP tests are unconstitutional as they violate the right against self‑incrimination and constitute testimonial compulsion under Article 20(3).[file:52]
      </li>
      <li>
        Compulsory administration of these techniques infringes Article 21 by invading mental privacy and potentially amounting to cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment; no statutory “medical examination” provision in CrPC can be expansively read to authorize them.[file:52]
      </li>
      <li>
        Test results obtained with consent have limited evidentiary value: they are not admissible as substantive proof of guilt, though information discovered as a consequence may be usable subject to ordinary evidentiary rules.[file:52]
      </li>
      <li>
        The judgment affirms that efficiency in investigation cannot override fundamental rights, and that scientific advances must operate within constitutional limits safeguarding human dignity and fair trial rights.[file:52]
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Significance:</h3>
    <p>
      Selvi is a landmark on the interface of criminal procedure, forensic science, and fundamental rights, setting clear constitutional limits on the use of coercive interrogation techniques and strengthening protections for mental privacy and autonomy.[file:52]
    </p>
    <p>
      The ruling guides courts and investigators on the admissibility and permissible use of scientific techniques, ensuring that the pursuit of truth in criminal justice remains consistent with Articles 20(3) and 21.[file:52]
