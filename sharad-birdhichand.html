    <h1>Sharad Birdhichand Sarda v. State of Maharashtra (1984)</h1>
    <p><strong>Citation:</strong> AIR 1984 SC 1622; (1985) 1 SCR 88; (1984) 4 SCC 116[file:51]</p>
    <p><strong>Bench:</strong> Syed Murtaza Fazal Ali, A. Varadarajan and Sabyasachi Mukharji, JJ.[file:51]</p>

    <h3>Background:</h3>
    <p>
      The appellant, Sharad Birdhichand Sarda, was tried along with two co‑accused for the alleged murder by poisoning of his wife Manjushree (Manju) within a few months of their marriage, the prosecution alleging administration of cyanide and conspiracy within the joint family.[file:51]
    </p>
    <p>
      The trial court convicted all three; the High Court acquitted accused 2 and 3 but confirmed the appellant’s conviction for murder and the sentence of death, leading to this appeal by special leave before the Supreme Court.[file:51]
    </p>

    <h3>Issues:</h3>
    <p>
      The Court examined whether the circumstantial evidence established beyond reasonable doubt that Manju’s death was homicidal by cyanide poisoning and that the appellant was responsible, and more broadly, what standard applies to convictions based purely on circumstantial evidence.[file:51]
    </p>

    <h3>Judgement:</h3>
    <p>
      The Supreme Court allowed the appeal, set aside the conviction and death sentence, and acquitted the appellant, holding that the prosecution had failed to prove a complete chain of circumstances inconsistent with any hypothesis other than guilt.[file:51]
    </p>
    <p>
      The Court reiterated that suspicion, however strong, cannot replace legal proof, that infirmities in the prosecution case cannot be cured by a false defence, and that circumstances not put to the accused under Section 313 CrPC cannot be used to convict.[file:51]
    </p>

    <h3>Key Takeaways:</h3>
    <ul style="margin-left:20px; font-size:1.1rem;">
      <li>
        Laid down the classic “five golden principles” (panchsheel) for circumstantial evidence: fully established circumstances, consistency only with guilt, conclusive nature, exclusion of every other hypothesis, and formation of a complete chain leading to the sole inference of guilt.[file:51]
      </li>
      <li>
        Clarified that in cases of alleged murder by poison, prosecution must prove (a) death by poison, (b) possession of poison by the accused, and (c) opportunity to administer it, in addition to motive.[file:51]
      </li>
      <li>
        Explained the doctrine of proximity and the scope of Section 32(1) Evidence Act regarding statements of the deceased, including what can qualify as circumstances of the transaction resulting in death.[file:51]
      </li>
      <li>
        Reaffirmed that when two views are reasonably possible on the evidence, one pointing to guilt and the other to innocence, the benefit of doubt must go to the accused.[file:51]
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Significance:</h3>
    <p>
      The decision is a leading authority on circumstantial evidence and continues to guide courts on the standard of proof required in such cases, particularly in serious offences like murder and poisoning.[file:51]
    </p>
    <p>
      It strengthens procedural safeguards by stressing careful appreciation of evidence, proper use of Section 313 CrPC, and the fundamental requirement that moral conviction alone cannot justify a criminal conviction in law.[file:51]
