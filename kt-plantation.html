    <h1>K.T. Plantation Pvt. Ltd. & Anr. v. State of Karnataka (2011)</h1>
    <p><strong>Citation:</strong> AIR 2011 SC 3430; (2011) 9 SCC 1 / 146</p>
    <p><strong>Bench:</strong> S.H. Kapadia C.J., Mukundakam Sharma, K.S. Radhakrishnan, Swatanter Kumar and Anil R. Dave, JJ.</p>

    <h3>Background:</h3>
    <p>
      The appeals arose from challenges to the Roerich and Devika Rani Roerich Estate (Acquisition and Transfer) Act, 1996, which acquired the Tatgunni Estate in Karnataka, and to a notification issued under Section 110 of the Karnataka Land Reforms Act, 1961 withdrawing exemption for linaloe cultivation.
    </p>
    <p>
      K.T. Plantation Pvt. Ltd. claimed title over substantial portions of the estate purchased from Dr. Svetoslav Roerich and Smt. Devika Rani and questioned the State’s power to withdraw exemption, reopen ceiling proceedings, and compulsorily acquire the estate, alleging violation of property rights under Article 300A and other constitutional provisions.

    <h3>Issues:</h3>
    <p>
      The Court considered: (i) the validity of Section 110 of the Karnataka Land Reforms Act and the notification dated 8 March 1994 withdrawing exemption for linaloe lands; (ii) the constitutional validity of the Roerich and Devika Rani Roerich Estate (Acquisition & Transfer) Act, 1996; and (iii) the nature, scope, and content of the right to property under Article 300A, including whether public purpose and compensation are implicit requirements.
    </p>

    <h3>Judgement:</h3>
    <p>
      The Supreme Court upheld Section 110 of the Karnataka Land Reforms Act and the notification withdrawing the exemption, holding that the State could validly revisit earlier orders and resume excess land in accordance with the statute.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Court also upheld the constitutional validity of the Roerich Estate Acquisition Act, holding that the Act was protected under Article 31A, pursued a legitimate public purpose (preservation of the estate, artworks, and cultural assets), and provided for compensation consistent with Article 300A.
    </p>

    <h3>Key Takeaways:</h3>
    <ul style="margin-left:20px; font-size:1.1rem;">
      <li>Article 300A protects property from deprivation except by authority of law, and such law must pursue a public purpose and satisfy standards of fairness; arbitrary expropriation is subject to judicial review.</li>
      <li>While “compensation” in the old Article 31 sense is not expressly required, a law depriving property cannot be confiscatory; some reasonable return or recompense related to the property’s value is generally inherent in Article 300A.</li>
      <li>Expropriatory legislation can be protected by Article 31A if it meets its conditions, thereby insulating it from challenge under Articles 14 and 19, but remains open to review under the basic structure and Article 300A standards.</li>
      <li>The State may withdraw statutory exemptions (such as for specific crops) and re-open ceiling proceedings where the statute expressly permits, provided it acts within the framework of the law and for a legitimate public purpose.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Significance:</h3>
    <p>
      The decision is a leading authority on the post-44th Amendment status of the right to property, clarifying that Article 300A embodies requirements of public purpose and non-arbitrary deprivation, and that expropriatory laws remain justiciable on grounds of arbitrariness and lack of fair compensation.
    </p>
    <p>
      It also illustrates judicial deference to acquisition in the public interest while insisting on constitutional discipline in the design and implementation of property-depriving statutes, influencing later jurisprudence on land acquisition and State takings.
