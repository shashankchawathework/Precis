    <h1>State of Haryana v. Mukesh Kumar & Ors. (2011)</h1>
    <p><strong>Citation:</strong> AIR 2012 SC 559; (2011) 10 SCC 404</p>
    <p><strong>Bench:</strong> Deepak Verma and Dalveer Bhandari, JJ.</p>

    <h3>Background:</h3>
    <p>
      The State of Haryana filed a civil suit through the Superintendent of Police, Gurgaon, claiming ownership of land measuring 8 biswas in the revenue estate of Hidayatpur Chhavni on the basis of adverse possession and seeking to set aside a sale deed, mutation, and prior decree in favour of the private owners.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trial court found that the State had failed to prove continuous and hostile possession and that revenue records showed the defendants as owners in possession, dismissing the State’s suit while decreeing the defendants’ counterclaim for possession.
    </p>

    <h3>Issues:</h3>
    <p>
      Whether the State could claim a declaration of ownership over private land solely on the plea of adverse possession and whether such a suit was maintainable in law, especially when the State is constitutionally obliged to protect citizens’ property.
    </p>

    <h3>Judgement:</h3>
    <p>
      The Supreme Court dismissed the State’s special leave petition, affirming the concurrent findings of the trial court, first appellate court, and High Court that the State neither proved adverse possession nor had locus standi to challenge the owners’ title.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Court strongly deprecated the conduct of the State and held that a welfare State and its departments, including the police, cannot be permitted to grab citizens’ property under the guise of adverse possession, terming such action “deplorable and disgraceful.”
    </p>

    <h3>Key Takeaways:</h3>
    <ul style="margin-left:20px; font-size:1.1rem;">
      <li>Long possession is not necessarily adverse possession; specific pleading of when possession became hostile is essential.</li>
      <li>A person (including the State) in alleged adverse possession cannot maintain a suit solely for declaration of ownership based on adverse possession.</li>
      <li>Welfare States and public authorities should not invoke adverse possession to dispossess citizens of their property.</li>
      <li>The Court recommended that Parliament reconsider and possibly abolish or substantially amend the law of adverse possession, given its potential for injustice.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Significance:</h3>
    <p>
      The decision is a strong reaffirmation that the State, as protector of citizens’ life and property, must not act as a land-grabber by relying on adverse possession, and it highlights the need for reform of adverse possession law in India.
    </p>
    <p>
      The case is widely cited for its critique of the doctrine of adverse possession and for emphasizing constitutional morality and fairness in the dealings of the State with private property owners.
