    <h2>Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala (1973)</h2>

    <p>
      The Kesavananda Bharati case (1973) dealt with the extent of Parliament's power to amend the Constitution. The Supreme Court held that while Parliament has wide powers to amend the Constitution, it cannot alter its "basic structure." The judgment recognized a distinction between justiciable fundamental rights and non-justiciable directive principles, stating that both are important, but directive principles cannot be used to abrogate fundamental rights entirely. The ruling upheld the validity of the Twenty-Fourth and Twenty-Fifth Amendments but curtailed Parliament's power to make changes that would affect the core principles underpinning the Constitution, such as democracy, rule of law, separation of powers, and judicial independence.
    </p>

    <h2>Analysis of the Judgement</h2>
    <p>
      The majority opinion established the principle that there are implied limitations on the Parliament's amending powers. The judgment cited comparative constitutional law—including Australian, Canadian, and Ceylonese examples—observing that constituent power cannot be used to destroy the Constitution's foundational checks and balances. The Court analyzed the nature of fundamental rights, their inalienability, and discussed how, despite broad amending powers, certain core provisions (such as federalism, secularism, judicial review, and the dignity of the individual) are inviolable. The judgment also emphasized the importance of judicial review and the independence of the judiciary as essential features.
    </p>

    <h2>Relevance in the Legal Field</h2>
    <p>
      The Kesavananda Bharati judgment is a cornerstone in Indian constitutional law. The Basic Structure Doctrine has served as a check against excessive amendments, protecting the Constitution from being rewritten beyond recognition or tilted toward authoritarianism. This doctrine has been invoked numerous times to strike down amendments that threatened the essential framework of the Indian polity, ensuring continuity and stability. Key features protected include judicial review, fundamental rights, federal structure, secularism, and democracy. The judgment's legacy ensures the supremacy of the Constitution and the protection of citizens' rights against legislative overreach.
