    <h1>A.K. Kraipak & Ors. v. Union of India & Ors. (1969)</h1>
    <p><strong>Citation:</strong> AIR 1970 SC 150[file:53]</p>
    <p><strong>Bench:</strong> Hegde, J. (for the Court)[file:53]</p>

    <h3>Background:</h3>
    <p>
      Under the Indian Forest Service (Initial Recruitment) Regulations, 1966, a Special Selection Board was constituted to select officers from the Jammu & Kashmir Forest Department to the newly created Indian Forest Service in senior and junior scales.[file:53]
    </p>
    <p>
      The Acting Chief Conservator of Forests, who was himself a candidate and whose appointment was under challenge by a rival Conservator, sat as a member of the Selection Board, participated when the cases of his rivals were considered, and was placed at the top of the select list while his rivals were excluded, leading to writ petitions under Article 32.[file:53]
    </p>

    <h3>Issues:</h3>
    <p>
      Whether the principles of natural justice, particularly the rule against bias (nemo judex in causa sua), apply to such “administrative” selection proceedings, and if so, whether the presence and participation of an interested member vitiated the entire selection to the Indian Forest Service.[file:53]
    </p>

    <h3>Judgement:</h3>
    <p>
      The Supreme Court held that the rules of natural justice apply to administrative as well as quasi‑judicial proceedings, especially where decisions have civil consequences, and that enquiries must be conducted in good faith, without bias, arbitrariness, or unreasonableness.[file:53]
    </p>
    <p>
      On facts, the Court found a real likelihood of bias: the Acting Chief Conservator was effectively a judge in his own cause; his participation in deliberations on his rivals and in drawing up the merit list vitiated the Selection Board’s decision and, consequently, the UPSC’s final recommendations based on it.[file:53]
    </p>

    <h3>Key Takeaways:</h3>
    <ul style="margin-left:20px; font-size:1.1rem;">
      <li>
        Natural justice supplements statutory law and applies to administrative decisions where rights and interests are affected; the rigid line between administrative and quasi‑judicial functions has blurred.[file:53]
      </li>
      <li>
        The rule against bias is a core component of natural justice; even the likelihood of bias—where a decision‑maker’s interest conflicts with duty—is sufficient to vitiate a decision.[file:53]
      </li>
      <li>
        High‑powered selection bodies are not exempt: their decisions can be struck down where proceedings are tainted, and subsequent consideration by higher authorities (like the UPSC) does not cure the initial defect.[file:53]
      </li>
      <li>
        Where selection to different scales (senior and junior) is made from a single pool in a tainted process, the entire selection may need to be set aside; partial validation is not feasible.[file:53]
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Significance:</h3>
    <p>
      A.K. Kraipak is a foundational judgment on natural justice in Indian administrative law, marking the shift from a narrow, form‑based view of quasi‑judicial acts to a broader, rights‑centric application of fair‑procedure norms to administrative decisions.[file:53]
    </p>
    <p>
      It is frequently cited for the propositions that natural justice aims to prevent miscarriage of justice, that its content depends on context, and that fairness and absence of bias are essential to the legitimacy of administrative action.[file:53]
