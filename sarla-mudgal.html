    <h1>Smt. Sarla Mudgal v. Union of India (1995)</h1>
    <p><strong>Citation:</strong> AIR 1995 SC 1531; (1995) 3 SCC 635</p>
    <p><strong>Bench:</strong> Kuldip Singh and R.M. Sahai, JJ.</p>

    <h3>Background:</h3>
    <p>
      Public interest litigation by Sarla Mudgal highlighted a growing practice where Hindu husbands, legally married under Hindu law, converted to Islam solely to enter polygamous second marriages while their first marriages subsisted, thereby evading bigamy charges under Section 494 IPC and leaving first wives destitute.
    </p>
    <p>
      Specific cases involved Jitender Mathur (married to Meena Mathur under Hindu law, converted to Islam to marry Sunita Narula), Pradeep Kumar (converted to marry Deepa after maltreating first wife Geeta Rani), and G.C. Ghosh (converted to marry Vinita Gupta while pressuring first wife Sushmita for divorce).
    </p>

    <h3>Issues:</h3>
    <p>
      Whether conversion to Islam dissolves a subsisting Hindu marriage, whether a second marriage after such conversion constitutes bigamy under Section 494 IPC, and whether Article 44's mandate for a Uniform Civil Code (UCC) requires legislative action to prevent abuse of personal laws through religious conversion.
    </p>

    <h3>Judgement:</h3>
    <p>
      The Supreme Court held that conversion to Islam does not automatically dissolve a Hindu marriage; the first marriage remains valid, making any subsequent marriage void and punishable as bigamy under Section 494 IPC.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Court issued writs restraining the converts from solemnising second marriages without first dissolving their Hindu marriages through competent courts and strongly urged Parliament to enact a UCC as mandated by Article 44 to eliminate such legal evasions and promote national integration.
    </p>

    <h3>Key Takeaways:</h3>
    <ul style="margin-left:20px; font-size:1.1rem;">
      <li>
        A Hindu marriage solemnised under codified Hindu law is not ipso facto dissolved by religious conversion; proper dissolution requires judicial decree under applicable personal law.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sham conversions to exploit polygamy under Muslim personal law while evading monogamy under Hindu law constitute fraud on both statutory law and judicial process, attracting criminal liability under Section 494 IPC.
      </li>
      <li>
        Article 44's directive for a Uniform Civil Code is more than aspirational; failure to implement it perpetuates discriminatory personal laws and undermines constitutional goals of equality and national unity.
      </li>
      <li>
        Marriage and family matters are secular concerns not protected by religious freedom under Articles 25-26; the State can regulate personal laws to prevent public harm and ensure justice.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Significance:</h3>
    <p>
      Sarla Mudgal is a landmark on the UCC debate, exposing conflicts between plural personal laws and constitutional uniformity while establishing that religious conversion cannot nullify civil obligations like monogamous marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judgment catalysed renewed legislative discourse on UCC and remains authoritative on bigamy-by-conversion, influencing subsequent jurisprudence on personal law reform and secular regulation of marriage.
