      <h2>Why Referring to Judgements Matters</h2>
      <p>
        Judgements form the foundation of our legal system. They shape the interpretation of laws, influence future 
        decisions, and uphold the values of justice and equality. Understanding these cases is vital not only for 
        those in the legal profession but also for individuals who wish to know their rights and responsibilities 
        under the law.
      </p>
      <p>
        By exploring case law, we uncover how judicial reasoning evolves to reflect changing societal values and 
        circumstances. Précis brings these valuable insights together — making legal learning approachable, 
        informative, and engaging.
