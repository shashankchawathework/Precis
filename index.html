      <h2>Why Referring to Judgements Matters</h2>
      <p>
        Judgements form the backbone of our legal system. They interpret laws, establish precedents, and uphold justice. 
        Understanding and referencing these cases is not only crucial for legal professionals and students, but also for 
        citizens who wish to be aware of their rights and duties. Case law shapes how statutes are applied and evolves 
        societal values through judicial reasoning.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you are studying law, working in the legal industry, or simply a curious learner, exploring case summaries 
        allows you to see how justice is reasoned, interpreted, and delivered in real life. Précis brings these insights 
        to you in concise, easy-to-understand summaries.
