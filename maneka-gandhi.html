      <h2>📘 Summary of the Judgement</h2>
      <p>
        The Supreme Court of India in <strong>Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India (1978)</strong> expanded the scope of Article 21 of the Constitution, holding that the "right to life and personal liberty" is not confined to mere physical existence, but includes the right to live with dignity. The Court ruled that any procedure depriving a person of their liberty must be "just, fair, and reasonable" and not arbitrary. The judgment clarified that Article 21 must be read in conjunction with other fundamental rights, particularly Articles 14 (equality) and 19 (freedom), establishing the principle that laws depriving liberty must satisfy the test of reasonableness and fairness. The Court also addressed the issue of impounding passports without prior hearing, emphasizing the requirement of natural justice, including the right to be heard, even in administrative actions affecting fundamental rights.

      <h2>🔍 Analysis of the Judgement</h2>
      <p>
        The judgement marked a monumental shift in constitutional jurisprudence by interpreting Article 21 as protecting a broad spectrum of rights essential to human dignity and personal liberty. It rejected a narrow and formalistic understanding of "procedure established by law" and introduced the "due process" concept into Indian law, requiring substantive fairness in addition to procedural safeguards. The ruling highlighted the interconnectedness of fundamental rights, stating that the exercise of personal liberty under Article 21 cannot be isolated from the safeguards of equality (Article 14) and freedom (Article 19). The Court also innovated the doctrine of post-decisional hearing in cases like passport impounding, balancing administrative efficiency with fairness. This expanded judicial protection against arbitrary state action and laid the foundation for recognizing rights such as privacy, travel, and personal autonomy within the ambit of Article 21.

      <h2>🏛️ Relevance in the Legal Field</h2>
      <p>
        The <strong>Maneka Gandhi</strong> judgement is a landmark in Indian constitutional law that significantly broadened the protection of individual rights against state action. It established that laws affecting personal liberty must comply with principles of reasonableness, fairness, and justice, which are essential features of the Constitution. This case has been foundational for the development of expansive civil liberties including the right to privacy, the right to travel abroad, and other personal freedoms. It has shaped legal thinking about the relationship between fundamental rights and administrative law, emphasizing procedural and substantive justice. The ruling continues to influence judicial review and constitutional interpretation by ensuring that individual freedoms are not curtailed arbitrarily or unjustly by the government.
