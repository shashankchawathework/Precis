      <h2>Summary of the Judgement</h2>
      <p>
        The Supreme Court of India in <strong>Vishaka v. State of Rajasthan (1997)</strong> addressed the issue of sexual harassment of women at the workplace in the absence of any specific legislation. The Court recognized sexual harassment as a violation of fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 14 (equality), 19 (freedom to practice profession), and 21 (right to life with dignity) of the Constitution. It laid down detailed guidelines, known as the Vishaka Guidelines, to prevent and address sexual harassment in workplaces. These guidelines imposed a duty on employers to provide a safe working environment and established mandatory complaint mechanisms, including the formation of complaints committees with a majority of women members. The judgement was passed as a public interest litigation to fill the legislative vacuum and protect women's rights effectively until specific laws were enacted.

      <h2>Analysis of the Judgement</h2>
      <p>
        This landmark judgement effectively created a legal framework for combating sexual harassment in workplaces, filling a critical gap due to the absence of statutory protection for women. The Court invoked Articles 14, 19, and 21, underscoring that sexual harassment interferes with women's constitutional right to equality, freedom to work with dignity, and personal liberty. The ruling also cited international conventions and norms supporting gender equality and human rights, emphasizing their relevance in interpreting constitutional provisions. The Court's guidelines placed responsibilities on employers to prevent harassment, provide a grievance redressal mechanism, and ensure disciplinary action against offenders. This judicial activism reflected the Court's role in advancing women's rights and social justice where the legislature had not yet acted.

      <h2>Relevance in the Legal Field</h2>
      <p>
        The <strong>Vishaka judgement</strong> is foundational in Indian labour and constitutional law concerning workplace safety and gender equality. It established sexual harassment as a violation of fundamental rights and set procedural precedents for addressing such violations. The Vishaka Guidelines paved the way for the enactment of the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013, which codified these protections into law. This case remains a crucial reference for gender justice, workplace rights, and the broader commitment to human dignity in Indian jurisprudence. It highlights how constitutional rights can be interpreted dynamically to address emerging social issues and protect vulnerable groups in the absence of specific legislation.
