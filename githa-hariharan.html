    <h1>Ms. Githa Hariharan & Anr. v. Reserve Bank of India & Anr. (1999)</h1>
    <p><strong>Citation:</strong> AIR 1999 SC 1149; (1999) 2 SCC 228</p>
    <p><strong>Bench:</strong> U.C. Banerjee, J. (Single‑Judge Bench)</p>

    <h3>Background:</h3>
    <p>
      In one petition, author Githa Hariharan challenged the Reserve Bank of India’s refusal to accept her as natural guardian for investments made in the name of her minor son, insisting instead on the father’s signature or a guardianship certificate, based on Section 6(a) of the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956 (HMGA).</p>
    <p>
      In a connected petition, a mother seeking custody complained that, despite the father’s apathy towards the child, he asserted exclusive status as “only natural guardian” under Section 6(a) HMGA read with Section 19(b) of the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890, leading to a challenge to the constitutional validity of these provisions under Articles 14 and 15.
    </p>

    <h3>Issues:</h3>
    <p>
      Whether the expression “the father, and after him, the mother” in Section 6(a) HMGA makes the mother a natural guardian only after the father’s death, thereby violating the equality and non‑discrimination guarantees of Articles 14 and 15, and how to interpret guardianship provisions consistently with the constitutional mandate of gender justice and the welfare of the child.
    </p>

    <h3>Judgement:</h3>
    <p>
      The Supreme Court upheld Section 6(a) by reading down the words “after him” to mean “in the absence of” or “when the father is unfit, indifferent, or not actually caring for the minor”, holding that both father and mother are natural guardians and the statute cannot be interpreted to give the father an absolute, exclusive preference.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Court ruled that, for purposes of decisions concerning the minor (including dealings with RBI), the mother can act as natural guardian during the father’s lifetime where the circumstances show that insisting on the father’s guardianship would be contrary to the child’s welfare and to the constitutional norm of gender equality.
    </p>

    <h3>Key Takeaways:</h3>
    <ul style="margin-left:20px; font-size:1.1rem;">
      <li>
        Section 6 HMGA must be interpreted in light of Articles 14 and 15 and international commitments like CEDAW; a narrow reading that subordinates the mother throughout the father’s lifetime is impermissible.
      </li>
      <li>
        The term “after him” in Section 6(a) is construed as “in the absence of” in the sense of legal, factual, or functional absence (e.g., neglect, apathy, separation), enabling the mother to be recognized as natural guardian even while the father is alive.
      </li>
      <li>
        The welfare of the child is the paramount consideration in guardianship matters; statutory provisions must be read to further that welfare rather than rigidly enforcing paternal preference.[file:55]
      </li>
      <li>
        State authorities and institutions (including banks and financial bodies) cannot rely on a formalistic reading of personal law to deny mothers their guardianship role where they are in fact caring for and managing the affairs of the minor.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Significance:</h3>
    <p>
      The decision is a major step in harmonising Hindu personal law with constitutional guarantees of gender equality, affirming that mothers are equal natural guardians and that statutory language must evolve with changing social realities.
    </p>
    <p>
      It continues to guide courts and authorities in treating both parents as capable guardians, strengthening the position of women in guardianship, custody, and property‑related decisions concerning minor children.
