      <h2>Summary of the Judgement</h2>
      <p>
        In <strong>Navtej Singh Johar v. Union of India (2018)</strong>, the Supreme Court of India unanimously declared Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), as it criminalized consensual homosexual acts between adults, to be unconstitutional insofar as it violated fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 14 (equality), 15 (non-discrimination), 19 (freedom of expression), and 21 (right to life and personal liberty) of the Constitution. The Court recognized sexual orientation as an essential attribute of privacy and dignity, firmly establishing that the LGBTQ+ community has equal rights under the Indian Constitution. The decision overturned previous judgments that upheld criminalization and affirmed the constitutional morality that protects individual identity against majoritarian social morality.

      <h2>Analysis of the Judgement</h2>
      <p>
        The judgement is a transformative milestone that emphasized the principles of constitutional morality, human dignity, privacy, and individual autonomy. It critically examined the concept of discrimination based on sexual orientation and underscored the dynamic and evolving nature of the Constitution as a living document. The Court relied on a detailed analysis of international human rights laws, prior landmark judgments like NALSA, and the doctrine of progressive realization of rights. It rejected societal prejudices and stigma, highlighting the inseparability of sexual orientation from the right to life with dignity. The ruling called for the equal legal recognition and protection of the LGBTQ+ community, affirming that constitutional rights extend to all, irrespective of sexual orientation.
